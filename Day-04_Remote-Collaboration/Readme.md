# Day 04 - Remote Collaboration Simulation

This folder simulates real-world Git collaboration using:

- A **bare repository** as a shared remote (`devops-project-remote`)
- A **developer working copy** (`devops-project-sim`)
- A **contributor clone** for feature branches (`contributor-clone`)

### Key Concepts Practiced:
- `git remote add`, `git fetch`, `git pull`
- `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, `git squash`
- Branch strategies: `contributor/*`, `integration/*`
- Clean handling of nested repositories
- Final code preserved in `Day-04_Remote-Collaboration/final-code`

All Git histories have been saved, and nested `.git` folders removed to preserve the integrity of the main repository.

> For full Git logs and screenshots, refer to `documentation/` folder in the root.
