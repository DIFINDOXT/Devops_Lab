# 📘 Day 3 – Advanced Git Operations

## ✅ Section 3.1: Reset vs Revert vs Checkout

### ✔️ What Was Practiced:
- git checkout <commit>
- git revert <commit>
- git reset --soft HEAD~n
- git reset --hard HEAD~n
- git reset HEAD <file>

### 🧠 Real-World Use Cases:
- Checkout: explore old commit safely
- Revert: undo a bad commit on main branch
- Reset (soft): squash multiple commits into one
- Reset (hard): remove sensitive or broken code
- Reset (mixed): unstage specific files
