# 🧪 DevopsLab Git Mastery – Hands-on Git Simulation Project

> **The most comprehensive Git learning experience for DevOps professionals**

Welcome to the **DevopsLab repository** – a structured, multi-day hands-on simulation for mastering Git like a real DevOps engineer. This repo demonstrates core Git concepts across **5 progressive days** of learning with actual project files, real branching logic, GitHub workflows, recovery commands, and team collaboration scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository is Different?

**This isn't just another Git tutorial** – it's a complete **DevOps Git simulation** that mirrors real-world scenarios:

- ✅ **Real project structure** - Not toy examples, but actual DevOps project layouts
- ✅ **Interview-focused** - Every scenario is something you'll face in DevOps interviews
- ✅ **Progressive complexity** - From basic branching to advanced Git hooks
- ✅ **Practical challenges** - Solve the same problems DevOps engineers face daily
- ✅ **Documentation mindset** - Learn to document like a professional
